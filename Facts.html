<a name="Mother">My mother is a hardworking person, she always goes to work in<br> Department of Justice (DOJ) and do a lot of works, example is she has three bosses,
 because their<br> office currently lacking with secretaries. She amazed me because of how she can manage that kind<br> of job and still making household 
 chores like cooking for our dinner. She is also a thrifty and<br> “know how to manage money” person. She always spent her money in what we need than 
 what<br> we want and she can save big amount of money without cutting the amount of other needs like foods.<br> Lastly, because I can’t even say her 
 characteristics that I always admire, she is a loving person.<br> She always took care of us first even when she is having cold or fever, giving
 us what we need,<br> and sometimes what we want before her own needs and wants and I can feel her love for us with<br> her sacrifices for us. And because 
 of her, I always took what I need before what I want<br> because I realized that what you want will make you happy but will not last, but what you need<br> 
 will give you the happiness that will lasts. I always think of other people, especially the important<br> people in my life, before myself and I am a 
 caring person because of her. That’s why<br> I love myMother forever.</p> </a>

<a name="HS">
My High School friends, these persons are always there when you need them.<br> They were the one who thought me that some friendships last and they will<br>
 never leave you when you are having a bad time. I learned that true friends<br> are there and it doesn’t matter if you are in good or bad situation and 
 made<br> me realized that friendship is a precious thing in this world. Therefore,<br> I also do it with my college friends, I want out friendship to last 
 longer and<br> hopefully until we get old. </p></a>
 <p> <img src= "College.jpg" height="200" width="200">
 <a name="College">
 My college friends,these persons are hardworking students,<br>we study hard and if we have a group project or research paper,<br> we are the one who always
finishing the task earlier than my fellow block mates.<br> We are also competitive, not the kind where we want others to fail, but we want to excel<br>
 and have good  competitions with them. We are also doing tasks neat and want them to be<br> perfect as they can. Because of them, now I do works with all I got 
 and give efforts to it.<br> Also, I always work hard and study hard in school where I never did in High School.<br> Like what I said before, I had an experience 
 where I’m going to  fail in a class but because<br> of these persons, I study hard and work hard for my grades and I successfully passed that class. </p></a>

 My Special Someone,we met in DLSU-D, and we are both taking BS-Psychology.<br> We always see each other in the gymnasium, but we stare at each other.<br>
 Then I message her in twitter, we talk and become friends and that's it,<br> I confessed to her that I like her and she said that she like me too.<br>
 I'm thankful to God because I met her, she pushes me to become<br> better everyday, she makes me happy in my down moments and most<br> importantly, 
 she made me realized that life is worth living, every moment,<br> every second. Hopefully, she's the one.</p></a>
